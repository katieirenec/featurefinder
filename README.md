featurefinder
=============

featurefinder finds genetic features near your regions of interest.

It's still under construction, but the goal is to find genes, CpG islands, and regulatory elements near genetic regions of interest.

Output is in a biologist-friendly format that can be visually inspected.

featurefinder is in Python so it can easily be run on any machine. On Mac and Linux, no additional downloads are needed!
