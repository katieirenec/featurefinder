featurefinder
=============

Featurefinder finds genetic features near your regions of interest.

The goal is to find genes, CpG islands, and regulatory elements near genetic regions of interest.
(It's still under construction)

Output will be in a biologist-friendly format that can be visually inspected or viewed in Excel.

Featurefinder is written in Python so it can easily be run on any machine, and doesn't use any features
outside the standard library.
